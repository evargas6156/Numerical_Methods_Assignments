# Numerical_Methods_Assignments

This repository contains any coding assignments completed for the MATH131 Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers course at the University of California, Merced. There are 7 coding assingments that were completed by me in the MatLab programing environment. The majority of the files are MatLab functions and must be run in a script or terminal with the appropriate arguments passed. The project was a group assingment, the adaptive quadrature script is my own work, it utilizes a third party Stack data structure implementation.
